# Front-End mentor QR challenge
Building a page with a QR from an exercise of Front-end mentor.

Following the design specifications of a beginner exercise of https://www.frontendmentor.io/ which involves creating a webpage featuring a
QR code with some text.

I downloaded some files provided by them, including images of how the design would look like in different screens, images to insert into the page
and text files with instructions.

## What did I use
Since I'm still starting i just used HTML & CSS following the box model and making the layout with Flex-box a feature of CSS.
